We have designed four robots which display different types of behavior usingonly two motors and sensors and altering the way those motors and sensors are connected. 
Robot 2A, the coward, has the left motor attached to the left sensor and the right motor attached to the right sensor. It will accelerate the higher the intensity of the light. Because of this the robot to turn through the direction of the source, causing one sensor to detect a higher intensity of light, causing it to rapidly turn away from the source.
Robot 2B, the aggressive, has the left motor attached to the right sensor, and the right motor attached to the left sensor. It will also accelerate the higher the intensity of the light. Since motor and sensor are crossed it will continuously correct itself while moving towards the source.
Robot 3A, the lover, implements the cowards wiring but will decelerate as source intensity increases. This causes it to slowly approach the source and stop in front of the source when the intensity reaches a predetermined threshold.
Robot 3B, the explorer, also implements the cowards wiring but will either decelerate or accelerate depending on the intensity of the source. When the robot is close to a source it will accelerate, displaying behavior of the coward. When the intensity of the source is low however the robot will decelerate as it approaches the source causing it to display behavior similar to the lover.
